# SupplyChain-Path-Optimizer

This project is designed to enhance logistics efficiency by calculating the most effective delivery routes from a central warehouse to various customer locations. Using advanced routing algorithms, the Supply Chain Path Optimizer identifies the shortest and most cost-effective paths to ensure timely and economical deliveries.

Technologies Used:

Graph theory algorithms (Dijkstra's and TSP) for route optimization.
Google Maps API for distance calculations and route mapping.
Node.js for backend server operations.
JavaScript and HTML for the frontend interface.
Objective:
Aim to minimize transportation costs and improve delivery times, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for diverse geographic regions and business sectors.
